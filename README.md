# Pinball
My journey creating a pinball arcade game from scratch

# What am I looking at?
This repo is not supposed to be any type of guide to how anyone **should** build or even repair a pinball machine! Rather, this is my journey to making one.

# Why does this exist?
I guess I have too much spare time on my hands... I am a 23 year old machine learning developer looking to pass some time, and I **love** creating things, bonus points if I can learn something along the way. Before we start, I want to add that I know barely anything about electronics or pinball machines, (If you've found this repo on your own this probably means you know a lot more about electronics and pinball machines than me). So if you feel like I'm about to electrocute myself make a issue explaining your concerns :D

# Is this all there is?
This repo started out as a single markdown file, however it quickly outgrew what seemed a reasonable size to read through.
The current structure of the documentation is as following.
/Models will contain all 3D models, hopefully structured in a orderly manner.
/Journal will contain my text entries as I progress with the project. I have a vision of keeping them organized as one entry per discovery/mechanic, though I believe it might end up differently...

Hope you enjoy the read!

**Note**: I'm finding a lot of spelling mistakes already. I'm writing this on a new split keyboard (dactyl manudox if interested) and I'm not used to it yet, have mercy.
